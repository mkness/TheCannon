% Context
With \thecannon, we have demonstrated that it is possible to use a
small training set of stars with noisy spectral data and known
stellar-parameter labels to build a data-driven probabilistic model of
stellar spectra that can be used to infer stellar-parameter labels for
other stars (with differently noisy spectral data).
% Aims
% Method
Here we train this system using stars with known stellar mass labels
obtained from a training set of stars with both
\kepler\ asteroseismological observations (hence the known masses) and
\apogee\ infrared spectral data.
We find that (after training) \thecannon\ can infer stellar
masses---and therefore also stellar ages---for red-giant stars using
infrared spectral data alone.
% Results
We demonstrate the validity of the stellar masses and ages by three
methods:
First, we use cross-validation to demonstrate label accuracy on the
training set; we find mass accuracies of roughly XXXX and age accuracies
of roughly ZZZZ for typical-quality \apogee\ spectra.
Second, we look at the dependence on mass (or age) of
\thecannon\ spectral expectation, and show that it makes good physical
sense:
The age indicators in the spectral space are associated with elements
that can be ``dredged up'' or elements where chromospheric activity is
visible, or XXXX or YYYY.
Third, we use \thecannon\ to estimate age labels for the entire
\apogee\ sample, and show that the ages of stellar structures in the
Milky Way follow expectations, even conditioned on abundances.
All three of these tests show that we can obtain red-giant mass and
age information from stellar spectra; these capabilities open up new
opportunities for Milky Way and stellar astrophysics.

\section{Introduction}\label{sec:Intro}

Asteroseismology surveys, such as \most, \corot, and \kepler, have
been extremely successful and productive in bringing us information
about stellar interiors and (therefore) ages.
These missions operate by taking high-cadence, high-precision stellar
photometry, in which stellar oscillation modes are visible in the
Fourier domain.
These missions have operated by taking long stretches of
uninterrupted, uniform, dense imaging data on thousands of individual
stars.
They are expensive missions, but absolutely critical to calibrate
physical stellar interior models and set standards for stellar
parameter estimation, all of which is required for the ultimate
success of the next generation of stellar surveys, particularly
including the \gaia\ Mission.

At the same time, there are many large spectroscopic surveys, such
as \apogee, \galah, and \gaiaeso, underway to measure the properties
of stellar \emph{exteriors}.
These surveys will take high signal-to-noise, high resolution spectra
of hundreds of thousands of stars, revealing detailed surface chemical
abundances.
One question that naturally arises is:
How do we use these two pieces of information (surface spectroscopy
and interior asteroseismology) to jointly infer stellar properties?
Another is:
Is there any way we could learn about stellar interiors from surface
spectroscopy?
After all, at current prices, the marginal cost of taking a spectrum of
a new star is very low relative to the marginal cost of getting its
asteroseismology.
If we can determine the interior properties of stars from surface
spectroscopy alone, even noisily, great opportunities would arise for
studying the stellar populations of the Milky Way and their formation.

\ldots DWH: What are our hypotheses about how mass or age might appear
in a stellar spectrum?  It might appear as dredge-up of evolved
material from the core into the photosphere.  It might appear as
chromospheric emission from a time-dependent magnetic field.  It might
appear as line-shape variations as stellar rotation evolves.  It might
appear as amplitude variations in non-LTE effects as convection scales
are different for stars of different masses.

\ldots DWH: Importantly, age might only appear in the spectra as
certain combinations of surface abundances that are highly covariant
with age.  For example, older stars in the Milky Way tend to be more
alpha-enhanced.  We will consider such age indicators illegitimate;
the purpose of this project is to obtain estimates for ages and masses
\emph{that work even within narrow abundance-selected subsamples}.

\section{Methods and data}

We make use of \tc\ (MKN CITE), which is a data-driven method for
determining stellar parameters and abundances.
\tc\ is a probabilistic model of stellar spectra---meaning that it
produces a likelihood function or a probability density in spectral
space---that is itself a function of stellar parameters and chemical
abundances (which we collectively call ``labels'').
The model is not based on physical models, but is instead learned
from a training set of stars with (assumed) known labels.
This learning is called the ``training step''.
The model is used to label a new star \emph{not} in the training set
by maximizing the likelihood of the label values given the new star's
spectrum.
This labeling is called the ``test step''.
\tc\ differs from other kinds of standard machine-learning methods
(such as random forest or deep neural networks) in that it contains an
explicit likelihood function, at both the training step and the test
step, so it is able to account for heteroskedastic noise and missing
data in the spectra of both the training and test stars.

In detail, the likelihood function we use for \tc\ in this work has a
gaussian form at each measured spectral wavelength, with a mean that
is a quadratic function of the labels, and a variance that consists of
an intrinsic variance added to an observational noise variance (from
photon noise and other sources).
DWH: EQUATIONS HERE.

We have shown in previous work (MKN CITE) that \tc\ does a good job
of modeling stellar spectra and delivering stellar parameters and
chemical abundances for stars with spectra taken by the \apogee\ project.
MKN: DESCRIBE APOGEE BRIEFLY HERE.

One difference between our use of the \apogee\ data and previous work
with the same data is in continuum estimation.
We work with continuum-divided spectra, and the method of continuum
estimation turns out to be important for performance.
MKN: DESCRIBE HOW WE OBTAIN OUR CONTINUUM ESTIMATES HERE.

In this project, we are once again using \apogee\ data, and once again
using \tc.
What's new is that we are adding stellar mass as a stellar parameter
in the label set provided to \tc\ in the training step, and delivered by
\tc\ in the test step.
Stellar mass is a parameter that is not usually considered visible in
spectral data; in the training set we are obtaining these stellar mass
parameters via asteroseismology.

In particular, the training set is taken from the \apokasc\ sample of
stars (MKN CITE).
This sample of stars are in common between the \kepler\ Mission
targets and the \apogee\ targets; they have high-quality infrared
spectra and also asterosesmological measurements.
The \kepler\ Mission (MKN CITE) took continuous, 30-min cadence (or
higher cadence) photometric observations of more than $10^5$ stars,
providing (at least for giant stars) measurements of the
asteroseismological frequencies and frequency splittings that indicate
stellar interior density structure.
The asteroseismological measurements are used---with stellar
models---to infer stellar masses and thus provide labels.

The training set of stars is a subset of 1500 stars from \citet{Martig2015}. These are \apokasc\ stars, with \numax\ and \deltanu\ measurements from \kepler, with corresponding spectra in the H-band across 1.5-1.7 $\micron$ at a resolution of R $\sim$ 22,500, observed as part of the \apogee\ survey. These stars have been selected with no warning or error in the \aspcap\ \code{FLAG} parameter provided by \apogee\ \citep{Ahn2014}, with no rotation flag set and with errors on the delta$\_$nu and nu$\_$max less than 5\,percent. These stars comprise a high signal-to-noise (SNR) sample, with an average SNR $\approx$ 330 $\pm$ 155. 

Five labels are used for training of \tc, the \teff, \logg, \feh, \alphafe\ and Mass. The training labels adopted were the \aspcap-corrected \citep{Meszaros2013} values for the \teff, \feh\ and \alphafe\ and the astroseismic value for \logg, as determined from the measured $\nu_{max}$ . The mass label was determined using the standard seismic scaling relation given in \ref{eqn1} \citep{SilvaAguirre2011,Chaplin2011}.

\begin{equation} \label{eq:mass}
M= \left( \frac{\nu_{\mathrm{max}}}{\nu_{\mathrm{max,\odot}}}\right)^3\  \left( \frac{\Delta \nu}{\Delta \nu_{\odot}}\right)^{-4} \ \left( \frac{T_{\mathrm{eff}}}{T_{\mathrm{eff,\odot}}}\right)^{1.5} \ .
\label{eq1}
\end{equation}
We adopt  $T_{\mathrm{eff,\odot}}=5777$ K, $\nu_{\mathrm{max,\odot}}=3140\ \mu$Hz, $\Delta \nu_{\odot}=135.03\ \mu$Hz. The solar values  $\Delta \nu_{\odot}$ and $\nu_{\mathrm{max,\odot}}$ are the ones used to build the APOKASC catalogue and were obtained by \cite{Hekker2013} with the OCT method.

\section{Validation of mass and age outputs}

For cross validation, we took the
